## Revised course version

**An updated version of this course is at https://ionides.github.io/401f18/
**

-----

## Course description

* An intermediate course in applied statistics, covering a range of topics in modeling and analysis of data including: review of simple linear regression, two-sample problems, one-way analysis of variance; multiple linear regression, diagnostics and model selection; two-way analysis of variance, multiple comparisons, and other selected topics. (4 Credits)

* Advisory Pre-requisites: MATH 115 and one of (STATS 180 or STATS 250 or STATS 280, STATS 412 or ECON 451). No credit granted if completed or enrolled in STATS 413.

* We will build on material in STATS 250. Notes and labs for 250 are [available online](https://open.umich.edu/find/open-educational-resources/statistics/statistics-250-introduction-statistics-data-analysis).
STATS 280, STATS 412 and ECON 451 are more advanced and therefore entirely adequate preparation. STATS 180 is a sufficient background but will require some extra catch-up.

##  Grading

* Weekly homeworks (20\%) due at the start of lab. Extensions will be granted upon request for up to two late homeworks. Subsequent late homeworks will receive no credit.
* Two lab quizzes (5\%+5\%) in lab on February 1 or 2, and March 29 or 30.
* Midterm exam (20\%) in class on Wednesday 2/21).
* Final exam (50\%) on Tuesday, April 24, 4:00pm - 6:00pm

Homework will be graded on completeness. 
To get these points, the homework must include two statements titled "Sources" and "Please explain".
 
* The statement of sources must list all books, internet resources or other people consulted while completing the homework. For example, "Sources: notes only," or, "Sources: collaboration with X and Y; web site Z," or, "Sources: notes and office hours."
Any material taken from any source, such as the internet, must be properly acknowledged. 
Directly copied text must be in quotation marks.
Directly copied equations must be explicitly referenced to the source.
Unattributed copying from any source is plagiarism, and has potentially [serious consequences](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/academic-integrity/academic-misconduct.html).

* The explanation request provides useful feedback for the GSI and instructor. For example, "Please explain: nothing, everything is clear," or, "Please explain: I'm confused by summation notation. What is $\sum_{i=1}^n j$?'' or, "Please explain: I wanted to add a label to a point on a graph. How do you do that in R?"

Homework will not be graded on correctness, to encourage independent work.
The GSI may provide some feedback on correctness, but students are responsible for checking their work against posted solutions.
