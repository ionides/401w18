\solution.
The null hypothesis here is $H_0: \beta_j=0$ for  
The test statistic is
\[f = \frac {(\RSS_0 - \RSS_a)/d}{\RSS_a/(n-q)},\]
where $d$ is the difference in degrees of freedom between the null and alternative hypotheses (here, $d=3$) and $q$ is the degrees of freedom in the alternative hypothesis (here, $q=1+18+1+3=23$), 
$\RSS_0$ is the residual sum of squares under the null hypothesis, and $\RSS_a$ is the residual sum of squares under the alternative.
A model-generated version $F$ for this statistic under the null hypothesis has the F distribution on $d$ and $n-q$ degrees of freedom. 
From the R output, the p-value is $\prob(F>f)= 0.925$.
The test result is insignificant at the usual 0.05 level. 
We infer that there is no evidence supporting systematic differences between years in field goal kicking percentage. 
This is evidence against a role for selection bias in the observed negative estimated value of the coefficient $\gamma$.

\grade{
1 point for f; 1 point for defining the degrees of freedom; 1 point for defining the RSS terms; 1 point for giving the p-value; 1 point for the conclusion.
