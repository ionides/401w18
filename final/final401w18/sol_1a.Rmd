\solution. 
\[ y_{ij}=m+a_i + b x_{ij} +e_{ij} \]
where $x_{ij}$ is the previous year kicking average for the $j$th measurement on kicker $i$, for $i=1,\dots,k$ and $j=1,\dots,4$, and $e_{ij}$ is the residual error. $m$ is the estimated intercept, $a_i$ is an additive effect for kicker $i$, with $a_1=0$. $b$ is the estimated coefficient for the effect of the previous year. All coefficients are estimated by least squares.

\grade{
Either this notation, or using a model for $y_i$, was accepted. Points were taken off for each error, including the following. (-1) if the probability model was written. (-1) for using matrix form. (-1) for lack of intercept. (-1) if missing the sum when needed. (-1) for having a coefficient for every level of the factor. (-1) if the error in the sample model is described as a random variable.
