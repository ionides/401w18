\solution.
`NA` estimates occur when the columns of the design matrix $\mat{X}$ are collinear.
Here, we can expect considerable collinearity between the team and the kicker. 
If a kicker stays with the same team throughout the 4 years of the dataset, the effect of this team and this kicker are indistinguishable.
This is equivalent to the corresponding columns of the design matrix being collinear.
 The effects only become distinguishable when the kicker changes team, and this apparently occurs on only 4 occasions.

\grade{
Basic points: R gives NA for a new variable collinear with previous ones; collinearity arises if a kicker doesn't change team. Points are for these basic points, plus two other points making a coherent argument. If the basic points are explained clearly, but with extra detail, only take off 1 point. If there are only 3 points but they provide a clear and complete answer, give full credit.
