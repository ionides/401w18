\solution.
$b$ is computed as a component of $\big(\mat{X}\mat{X}^\transpose\big)^{-1}\mat{X}^\transpose \vect{y}$.
According to the implicit probability model for Question~1, the sample coefficient $b=-0.504$ is an unbiased estimate of a true coefficient $\beta$ with variance given by the corresponding diagonal term of $\sigma^2\big(\mat{X}\mat{X}^\transpose\big)^{-1}$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the measurement error model and $\mat{X}$ is the design matrix. 
We estimate $\sigma^2$ by $s^2=\frac{1}{n-p}\sum_{i=1}(y_i-\hat y_i)^2$ where $\hat y_i$ is the fitted value and $p=20$ is the degrees of freedom.
This gives us a standard error which, from the R output provided, is 
\[
\SE=0.113.
\]
Using a normal approximation, a 95% confidence interval is $[b-1.96\times\SE,b+1.96\times\SE]$.
